# Algorithms in Calculus

This repo contains code for some algorithms seen in the Calculus 2 class:
- Teacher: Anier Velasco Sotomayor
- Course: Calculus 2, 2024.
- University: Harbour Space University

## Current files:
- [Numerical Differentiation](https://github.com/aniervs/calculus2/blob/main/numerical_diff.ipynb): Contains code for Newton's method, Bisection Method and a recursive algorithm to find all roots.

## How to use:
- Clone the repo
- Create a Python environment
- Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the important libraries.

## Note:
For now it's just a bunch of jupyter notebooks. Later, it will become a more structured code.
